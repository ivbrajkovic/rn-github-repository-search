## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rn-github-repository-search.git
   cd rn-github-repository-search
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Run the app on an emulator:
   - For Android: `pnpm android`
   - For iOS: `pnpm ios`
   - For web preview: `pnpm web`

## üìñ Feature Explanations

### Search Functionality

- Users can enter text into the search bar to query GitHub repositories
- The input is debounced (300ms) for performance, ensuring minimal API calls
- Real-time results update as you type
- Advanced sorting options (stars, forks, last update)

### Scrollable List

- Results are displayed in a scrollable list using `FlatList` for efficient rendering
- Infinite scroll is implemented to load more results as the user scrolls
- Pull-to-refresh provides a way to reload the latest data
- Each item displays repository name and last update time

### Repository Details

- Tapping on a repository navigates to a detail screen showing:
  - Repository name
  - Last update time
  - Owner information with avatar
  - Full description
  - Statistics (stars, forks, etc.)

### User Interface

- Light and dark theme support with system preference detection
- Responsive design works on various screen sizes
- Graceful error states with retry options
- Loading states with skeleton loaders

### Developer Experience

- Mock API for offline development without GitHub rate limits
- Full TypeScript coverage for type safety
- RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Hot reload support for fast development iteration

---

## üß™ Testing and Mocking

### Unit Tests

- The project includes unit tests for hooks and components
- Run tests using:
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

### Mocking

- Mock data is used to simulate API responses for testing
- Mock files are located in `src/mocks/`
- Switch to mock API to avoid rate limits during development:

```tsx
// Replace real API hook with mock version
import { useSearchRepositoriesMockQuery } from '../store/api/mock-api';

const { data, isLoading, error } = useSearchRepositoriesMockQuery({
  query: 'react',
  page: 1,
  per_page: 20,
  sort: 'stars',
  order: 'desc',
});
```
